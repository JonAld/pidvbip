Known bugs and unimplemented features

AUDIO-RELATED

* Remove duplicated audio code in MPEG and AAC codecs and improve PCM API (create ao_pi?)

* AAC/HE-AAC - correctly initialise codecdata based on info from tvh (stream info or a ADTS header).  Also test format changes.

* Implement AC3/EAC3 codec (? Is ffmpeg the only open source E-AC3 codec?)

* Deal with different channels/samplerate etc in MPEG audio codec (currently hard-coded for 48KHz Stereo)


VIDEO-RELATED

* Deal with MPEG-2 stream not being decoded fast enough (queue will grow forever)

* H264 video codec is unreliable - Freeview HD streams at least will sometimes not start, or only start after a few seconds.

* H264 video codec is not smooth - perhaps need to pre-buffer some frames to ensure the GPU always has data to decode/display

* Implement A/V sync for H264 video

* Implement double-buffering in MPEG-2 codec to eliminate tearing


CORE FEATURES

* Document build process, including the required dependencies (libfaad, libmpg123)

* Implement a UI!

* Implement channel change, including sending messages to codec threads to stop/restart.  Related - shutdown cleanly.

* Properly deal with S64 integers in htsp.c (code currently sometimes assumes they are all 32-bit)

* Catch ^C and reset keyboard (and cleanly close down codecs)

* Deal with network disconnections from tvheadend - test killing tvheadend, removing network cable etc...

* Implement subtitles

* Implement support for Radio stations (no video stream)

* Deal with off-air channels.
