Known bugs and unimplemented features

PLAYBACK-RELATED

* Channel changing often fails for the first change (but if the first
  change works, it then works for future changes).

* Implement timeshift support (initially pause/resume, then skipping,
  then full seeking).

AUDIO-RELATED

* AAC/HE-AAC - correctly initialise codecdata based on info from tvh
  (stream info or a ADTS header) instead of assuming 48KHz Stereo.

* Implement E-AC3 codec (? Is ffmpeg the only open source E-AC3
  codec?)

* AC-3 decoder always downmixes to Stereo - can we output 5.1 over
  HDMI?

* Implement HW pass-through of AC-3 (and other codecs?) - detect HDMI
  audio capabilities and send raw data when possible.

* Deal with different channels/samplerate etc in MPEG audio codec
  (currently hard-coded for 48KHz Stereo)


VIDEO-RELATED

* One user has reported that his TV loses the HDMI connection with his
  Pi and reconnects.  This happens after watching a channel for a few
  minutes.

* Fields are out of sync 50% of the time when outputting interlaced
  content in an interlaced video mode.  Fix is required in GPU
  firmware.  Workaround is to change channels and then come back to
  see if you're lucky.

OSD-RELATED

* Implement an "alert" widget to display status messages from tvh -
  use when pidvbip is initially syncing with tvh, and then when there
  are problems (e.g. "No input detected").

* Implement an OSD API and build a UI.

* Font rendering code doesn't fully support utf-8 (only iso-8859-1).

* Need EPG grid view, plus ability to do "up/down/left/right" in info
  screen to view info for different channels and different events.


CORE FEATURES

* Implement a full config file (and parameter passing) to configure pidvbip.

* Review channel change implementation - ensure things are being
  opened/closed appropriately and there are no memory leaks.  pidvbip
  freezes if you change channel too quickly in succession.

* Properly deal with S64 integers in htsp.c (code currently sometimes
  assumes they are all 32-bit)

* Catch ^C and reset keyboard (and cleanly close down codecs)

* Deal with network disconnections from tvheadend - test killing
  tvheadend, removing network cable etc...

* Implement subtitles

* Deal with off-air channels.

* Collect EPG data from server and maintain internal EPG database
  (data is collected, but in a very naive format)

* Support connecting to multiple servers, merging channel list.
  Servers will be listed in priority order, and duplicate channels
  renumbered to a high range (e.g. 1000+)

* avahi discovery only returns the first discovered instance of
  tvheadend
