Known bugs and unimplemented features

* Deal with MPEG-2 stream not being decoded fast enough (queue will grow forever)

* Implement AAC/HE-AAC codec

* Implement AC3/EAC3 codec

* H264 video codec is unreliable - Freeview HD streams at least will randomly fail to play

* H264 video codec is not smooth - perhaps need to pre-buffer some frames to ensure the GPU always has data to decode/display

* Implement a UI!

* Implement channel change, including sending messages to codec threads to stop/restart.  Related - shutdown cleanly.

* Implement double-buffering in MPEG-2 codec to eliminate tearing

* Implement A/V sync

* Properly deal with S64 integers in htsp.c (code currently assumes they are all 32-bit)

* Deal with different channels/samplerate etc in MPEG audio codec (currently hard-coded for 48KHz Stereo)

* Catch ^C and reset keyboard (and cleanly close down codecs)

* Deal with network disconnections from tvheadend - test killing tvheadend, removing network cable etc...

* Audio stream is sometimes mis-detected as stream index 371

* Implement subtitles

* Implement support for Radio stations (no video stream)

* Deal with off-air channels.
